Linux, OSX : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abhijithanilkumar/NetworkViz.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abhijithanilkumar/NetworkViz.jl)

Windows : [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/c7ktq0w08yq281gt/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/abhijithanilkumar/networkviz-jl/branch/master)

A Julia module to render graphs in 3D using [ThreeJS](https://github.com/rohitvarkey/ThreeJS.jl) tightly coupled with [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl).

## Install

In a Julia REPL, run:

```julia
Pkg.add("NetworkViz")
```
## Graph Algorithms Used

* [Force Directed Placement](http://emr.cs.iit.edu/~reingold/force-directed.pdf)

## Graph Primitives

### NodeProperty

The `NodeProperty` type stores the properties of each node in the graph. It stores the following properties :

* `color` : It is a `Colors` array that stores the colors of all the nodes in the graph.
* `size` : Size of the node. eg : `0.2`.
* `shape` : Shape of the node. Can be 0 or 1. `0 - Square`, `1 - Circle`.

### EdgeProperty

The `EdgeProperty` type stores the properties of each edge in the graph. It stores the following properties :

* `color` : It is a hex string that stores the color of the edges.
* `width` : Thickness of the edges. eg : `1.5`.

## Visualizing Graphs

The `drawGraph` function can be used to draw the graphs in 2D or 3D with nodes having different colors. It can accept `LightGraphs.Graph` and `LightGraphs.Digraph` types. `drawGraph` can be used to draw graphs from adjacency matrices also. The function accepts an additional kwargs `node::NodeProperty`, `edge::EdgeProperty`, and `z`. If `z=1`, it draws a 3D graph. If `z=0`, a 2D visualization of the graph is drawn. `node` and `edge` determines the properties of nodes and edges respectively.

Usage :
```julia
g = CompleteGraph(10)
c = Color[parse(Colorant,"#00004d") for i in 1:nv(g)]
n = NodeProperty(c,0.2,0)
e = EdgeProperty("#ff3333",1)
drawGraph(g,node=n,edge=e,z=1) #Draw using a Graph object (3D).

am = full(adjacency_matrix(g))
drawGraph(am,node=n,edge=e,z=0) #Draw using an adjacency matrix (2D).

dgraph = bfs_tree(g,1)
drawGraph(dgraph,z=1) #Draw a Digraph.
```
## Utility Functions

* `addEdge(g::Graph,node1::Int,node2::Int,z=1)` - Add a new edge `node1-node2` and redraws the graph. `z` toggles 2D-3D conversion. Fails silently if an already existing node is added again.
* `removeEdge(g::Graph,node1::Int,node2::Int,z=1)` - Removes the edge `node1-node2` if it exists and redraws the graph. `z` toggles 2D-3D conversion.
* `addNode(g::Graph,z=1)` - Adds a new node to the graph. `z` toggles 2D-3D conversion.
* `removeNode(g::Graph,node::Int,z=1)` - Removes `node` if it exists and redraws the graph. `z` toggles 2D-3D conversion.

## Examples

```julia
#Run this code in Escher
using NetworkViz
using LightGraphs
main(window) = begin
  push!(window.assets, "widgets")
  push!(window.assets,("ThreeJS","threejs"))
  g = CompleteGraph(10)
  drawGraph(g)
end
```
The above code produces the following output :

[Here](https://github.com/abhijithanilkumar/NetworkViz.jl/blob/master/examples/codemirror.jl) is another example with a code-mirror where functions can be typed in. Depending on the LightGraphs function used, 2D as well as 3D graphs are drawn. You can see the working demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac3cneCRTZo).

You can find many other examples in the `examples/` folder.
